# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my homelab docs site!

This site's purpose is to help others around the same obstacles that I've faced. As random as they may be. And also to remind future me, in a concise, short manner.

## Hardware

I like older hardware and will always try to find a good use for it. Much of what will be written here will have to do with some of my outdated machines and how to give them a life after the age of mediasystemd.

* Pavilion dm-1
* Anbernic RG556
* Raspberry Pico GP2040-CE
* And more

```javascript
console.log('Hello world!');
```

```yml
name: 'push-remote'

on:
	push:
		branches:
		  - master
		paths-ignore:
		  - .gitignore
		  - README.md
		  - LICENSE
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
